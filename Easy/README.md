### Hangman Game

**About**   
Games can help you kill time when you’re bored. But before smartphones, people played games the classic way – with paper and pencil. 
Let’s recreate one such game and improve your programming skills in the process. 
In this project, you will code Hangman, a game where the player has to guess a word, letter by letter, in a limited number of attempts. 
Make a program that plays Hangman with you – and good luck with the guessing!

**Learning outcomes**   
Best project for Python Basics: uses functions, loops, lists, and other variables. 
The Random module is a cherry on top. 
Don’t be intimidated by the number of stages – they ensure that your immersion in Python is smooth and safe.

### Credit Calculator

**About**   
Finance is an important part of the life of any people. Sometimes you think about getting additional income and want to open a deposit account.

### Cofee Machine

**About**   
What can be better than a cup of coffee during a break? A coffee that you don’t have to make yourself. 
It’s enough to press a couple of buttons on the machine and you get a cup of energy; but first, we should teach the machine how to do it. 
In this project, you will work on programming a coffee machine simulator. 
The machine works with typical products: coffee, milk, sugar, and plastic cups; if it runs out of something, it shows a notification. 
You can get three types of coffee: espresso, cappuccino, and latte. Since nothing’s for free, it also collects the money.

**Learning outcomes**   
This project allows you to get a taste of Python. 
Practice working with functions, challenge yourself with loops and conditions, and get more confident in Python.

Pack up and let’s hit the road, my friend!

**Learning outcomes**   
You’ll get to know the basic syntax of Python and write a simple program using variables, conditions, loops, and functions.
