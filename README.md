# TIC TAC TOE

About

Everybody remembers this paper-and-pencil game from childhood: 
Tic-Tac-Toe, also known as Noughts and crosses or Xs and Os. 
A single mistake usually costs you the game, but thankfully it is simple enough that most players discover the best strategy quickly. 
Let’s program Tic-Tac-Toe and get playing!

Learning outcomes

After finishing this project, you'll get to know a lot about planning and developing a complex program from scratch, 
using classes and functions, handling errors, and processing user input. 
You will also learn to use OOP (Object-Oriented Programming) in the process.

# SIMPLE BANKING SYSTEM

About

Everything goes digital these days, and so does money. Today, most people have credit cards, which save us time, energy and nerves. 
From not having to carry a wallet full of cash to consumer protection, cards make our lives easier in many ways. 
In this project, you will develop a simple banking system with database.

Learning outcomes

In this project, you will find out how the banking system works and learn about SQL.
We'll also see how Luhn algorithm can help us avoid mistakes when entering the card number. 
As an overall result, you'll get new experience in Python.

# ROCKET SCISSORS PAPER

About

If you’ve ever wanted to create games, this project will get you started! 
In this project you will code a Rock-Paper-Scissors-Lizard-Spock game, a more advanced version of Rock-Paper-Scissors, which can be played against the computer.

Learning outcomes

Practice using arrays, the Random library, formatted strings, and algorithms.

# NUMERIC MATRIX PROCESOR

Here’s a project for devoted matrix enthusiasts: 

learn to perform a variety of operations on matrices including addition, multiplication, finding the determinant, and dealing with inverse matrices. 
If you are working on your tech or math major, this project is a good chance for you to learn matrices in action and not just in your notebook.

Learning outcomes

Apart from learning a whole lot about matrices, you will become familiar with the Math library, recursion, and the many ways of using nested lists in practice.

# SMART CALCULATOR

About

Calculators are a very helpful tool that we all use on a regular basis. 
Why not create one yourself, and make it really special? 
In this project, you will write a calculator that not only adds, subtracts, and multiplies, but is also smart enough to remember your previous calculations.

Learning outcomes

Apart from writing a useful program (everyone uses calculators!), you will learn a lot about lists, strings and dictionaries. 
You will also get closer experience with 2 important data structures: the stack and the queue.
