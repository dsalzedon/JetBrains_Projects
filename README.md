## Easy

### Zookeeper

**About**...
This short code challenge can help the local zoo look after its denizens. You will create a tool for monitoring animals and their status.

**Learning outcomes**...
This project is aimed at our beginners. 
It helps you understand some syntax basics and learn how to work with variables, data storage types such as lists, and while loops.

### Hangman Game

**About**

Games can help you kill time when you’re bored. But before smartphones, people played games the classic way – with paper and pencil. 
Let’s recreate one such game and improve your programming skills in the process. 
In this project, you will code Hangman, a game where the player has to guess a word, letter by letter, in a limited number of attempts. 
Make a program that plays Hangman with you – and good luck with the guessing!

**Learning outcomes**

Best project for Python Basics: uses functions, loops, lists, and other variables. 
The Random module is a cherry on top. 
Don’t be intimidated by the number of stages – they ensure that your immersion in Python is smooth and safe.

### Credit Calculator

**About**

Finance is an important part of the life of any people. Sometimes you think about getting additional income and want to open a deposit account. 
And sometimes you need additional money right now and want to take a credit or mortgage. 
Anyway, you may want to calculate different financial indicators to make a decision. 
Let’s make such an instrument that can help us.

**Learning outcomes**

You’ll learn how to use mathematics and Python in everyday tasks, use third-party modules and libraries. 
Also, you’ll learn more about different financial instruments. 
Finally, you will make your own credit calculator!

### Cofee Machine

**About**

What can be better than a cup of coffee during a break? A coffee that you don’t have to make yourself. 
It’s enough to press a couple of buttons on the machine and you get a cup of energy; but first, we should teach the machine how to do it. 
In this project, you will work on programming a coffee machine simulator. 
The machine works with typical products: coffee, milk, sugar, and plastic cups; if it runs out of something, it shows a notification. 
You can get three types of coffee: espresso, cappuccino, and latte. Since nothing’s for free, it also collects the money.

**Learning outcomes**

This project allows you to get a taste of Python. 
Practice working with functions, challenge yourself with loops and conditions, and get more confident in Python.

### Simple Chatty Bot

**About**

Here, at the beginning of your programmer’s path, creating a simple console chat bot will do wonders to guide you through the basics of coding. 
During this journey you will also play some word and number games that you are going to implement all on your own. 
Pack up and let’s hit the road, my friend!

**Learning outcomes**

You’ll get to know the basic syntax of Python and write a simple program using variables, conditions, loops, and functions.

### Tic Tac Toe

**About**

Everybody remembers this paper-and-pencil game from childhood: 
Tic-Tac-Toe, also known as Noughts and crosses or Xs and Os. 
A single mistake usually costs you the game, but thankfully it is simple enough that most players discover the best strategy quickly. 
Let’s program Tic-Tac-Toe and get playing!

**Learning outcomes**

After finishing this project, you'll get to know a lot about planning and developing a complex program from scratch, 
using classes and functions, handling errors, and processing user input. 
You will also learn to use OOP (Object-Oriented Programming) in the process.

### Simple Banking System

**About**

Everything goes digital these days, and so does money. Today, most people have credit cards, which save us time, energy and nerves. 
From not having to carry a wallet full of cash to consumer protection, cards make our lives easier in many ways. 
In this project, you will develop a simple banking system with database.

**Learning outcomes**

In this project, you will find out how the banking system works and learn about SQL.
We'll also see how Luhn algorithm can help us avoid mistakes when entering the card number. 
As an overall result, you'll get new experience in Python.

### Rocket Scissors Paper

**About**

If you’ve ever wanted to create games, this project will get you started! 
In this project you will code a Rock-Paper-Scissors-Lizard-Spock game, a more advanced version of Rock-Paper-Scissors, which can be played against the computer.

**Learning outcomes**

A playable Rock-Paper-Scissors game, with a Player vs Computer mode. 
Practice using arrays, the Random library, formatted strings, and algorithms.

### Numeric Matrix Processor

**About**

Here’s a project for devoted matrix enthusiasts
learn to perform a variety of operations on matrices including addition, multiplication, finding the determinant, and dealing with inverse matrices. 
If you are working on your tech or math major, this project is a good chance for you to learn matrices in action and not just in your notebook.

**Learning outcomes**

Apart from learning a whole lot about matrices, you will become familiar with the Math library, recursion, and the many ways of using nested lists in practice.

### Smart Calculator

**About**

Calculators are a very helpful tool that we all use on a regular basis. 
Why not create one yourself, and make it really special? 
In this project, you will write a calculator that not only adds, subtracts, and multiplies, but is also smart enough to remember your previous calculations.

**Learning outcomes**

Apart from writing a useful program (everyone uses calculators!), you will learn a lot about lists, strings and dictionaries. 
You will also get closer experience with 2 important data structures: the stack and the queue.
